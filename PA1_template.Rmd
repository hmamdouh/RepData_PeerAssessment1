# Question 1:What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
The way I approached to  solve this problem is by using dplyr package and to group_by the activity dataframe by days and then summarize the total number of steps using the summarize function so that the final total number of steps will be averaged over all the 5 mins interval in the day

## Question 1 part 1: Calculate total steps per day
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
activity_total_steps_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))
```
## Question 1 part 2: plotting the total number of steps per day
Using the base plot function of type histogram, I am plotting the total number of steps per day as shown in the next code and followed by the graphs

``` {r echo=TRUE}
with(activity_total_steps_day,plot(date,total_steps_day,type="h",lwd=8,xlab="Date",ylab="Total number of steps",main="Total number of steps per day"))
```

## Question 1 part 3: Reporting the mean and median of total steps per day
In this part, we are going to summarize the activity dataframe by the mean and the median as well as the total steps perday

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_total_steps_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE),mean_steps_day=mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),median_steps_day=median(steps[steps>0],na.rm=TRUE))
```

The mean of the total number of steps per day is:

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_total_steps_day$mean_steps_day
```

The median of the total number of steps per day is:

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_total_steps_day$median_steps_day
```

## Question 2: What is the average daily activity pattern?
Here we want to see the daily activity for each 5 mins interval.So (24 hours * 60 minutes) / 5 minutes interval = 288 groups of 5 mins interval throughout the 24 hours of the day. So what I need to do here is to figure out the total number of steps along these 288 chunks everyday and see when is the most active time (5mins interval in the day)

So first we are going to have these 288 chunks of 5 mins intervals multiplied by the total number of days.
First, we are going to mutate the original activity dataframe with the 288 chunks*61days
Second, Group the activity dataframe by the 5mins interval chunks then summarize by the avg number of steps fo each 5mins chunk
Third, plot the avg steps per each 5mins chunk
Fourth, report which 5mins interval has the max number of steps

```{r echo=TRUE}
mins_intervals <- rep(c(1:288),nrow(activity_total_steps_day))
activity <- activity %>% mutate(min5_chunks=mins_intervals,which_day=weekdays(date))
activity_mins_interval <- activity %>% group_by(min5_chunks) %>% summarize(avg_steps_min5_interval=mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE))
```

In the following plot, you will see that around the 100th 5min chunk in everyday, will be the most active time. Calculating what does that mean (100/288)*24hours of the day ~ between 8am and 9am in the morning which makes sense. and in the very first and very last chunks, the data is almost zero where the day is just starting or ending repectively

```{r echo=TRUE}
with(activity_mins_interval,plot(min5_chunks,avg_steps_min5_interval,type="l",xlab="The 5mins chunks",ylab="Avg number of steps",main="Average number of steps of the 5mins chunks everyday"))
```

Which 5mins interval between the 288 chunks of the day has the max activity?

```{r echo=TRUE}
which.max(activity_mins_interval$avg_steps_min5_interval)
```

##Question 3: Imputting missing data
My methodology here toimput missing data is to find the mean of the missing 5mins interval across the same day and put that in the missing place

Here, I am reporting the number of missing values in the steps variable of the activity data frame:
```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```

Here is the methodology for imputting the data:

```{r echo=TRUE}
for (i in 1:nrow(activity)) {
  if (is.na(activity[i,]$steps)) {
    this_day <- activity[i,]$which_day
    this_chunk <- activity[i,]$min5_chunks
    this_mean <- mean(activity[activity$min5_chunks==this_chunk&activity$which_day==this_day,]$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
    activity[i,]$steps <- this_mean
  } 
}

```

Comparingactivity dataframes before and after the imputting:

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_total_steps_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

old_activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
old_activity$date <- as.Date(old_activity$date,"%Y-%m-%d")

old_activity_total_steps_day <- old_activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

```

Here is the plot
```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
with(activity_total_steps_day,plot(date,total_steps_day,type="h",lwd=8,main="New Activity plot after imputting"))
with(old_activity_total_steps_day,plot(date,total_steps_day,type="h",lwd=8,main="Old Activity plot before imputting"))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

```

Reporting the mean and median for the dataframe before imputting:
```{r echo=TRUE}
old_activity_total_steps_day <- old_activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE),mean_steps_day=mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),median_steps_day=median(steps[steps>0],na.rm=TRUE))

old_activity_total_steps_day$mean_steps_day
old_activity_total_steps_day$median_steps_day

AfterImput_activity_total_steps_day <- activity %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(total_steps_day=sum(steps,na.rm=TRUE),mean_steps_day=mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE),median_steps_day=median(steps[steps>0],na.rm=TRUE))

AfterImput_activity_total_steps_day$mean_steps_day
AfterImput_activity_total_steps_day$median_steps_day
```

##Comparing the steps during weekdays and weekends
Here I am going to split the activity dataframe into weekends data and weekdays data and plot the comparison and see how it changes.

```{r echo=TRUE}
activity <- activity %>% mutate(weekday_or_end=ifelse(which_day=="Saturday"|which_day=="Sunday",c("weekend"),c("weekday")))
activity$weekday_or_end <- as.factor(activity$weekday_or_end)
activity_subset <- activity %>% group_by(weekday_or_end,min5_chunks) %>% summarize(avg_steps=mean(steps,na.rm=TRUE))

activity_weekday <- subset(activity_subset,weekday_or_end=="weekday")
activity_weekend <- subset(activity_subset,weekday_or_end=="weekend")

```

As will be shown in the following plot, that the activity during weekends are more than the activity during weekdays:

```{r echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(activity_weekday$min5_chunks,activity_weekday$avg_steps,type="l",main="Avg steps for the 5 mins interval averaged over the weekday days")
plot(activity_weekend$min5_chunks,activity_weekend$avg_steps,type="l",main="Avg steps for the 5 mins interval averaged over the weekend days")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
